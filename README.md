# Classify High-Dimensional Data
1. In machine learning, classification is a task that assigns a class label to examples from the problem domain. However, high dimensionality poses significant statistical challenges and renders many traditional classification algorithms impractical to use.

2. In this project, I learnt some classical supervised classification techniques and discussed the curse of dimensionality. After that, I explored Penalized Discriminant Analysis (PDA), which is designed to classify high-dimensional data as an extension of the classical Linear Discriminant Analysis. It classifies data by finding the optimal lower-dimension projections that reveal “interesting structures” in the original dataset.

3. Afterwards, I implemented PDA to analyze a real-life colon cancer dataset alongside a simple toy example with large dimension count but small sample size.
